Graphs are an essential data structure in computer science for modeling networks.

Important Terms-
vertex: A node in a graph.
edge: A connection between two vertices.
adjacent: When an edge exists between vertices.
path: A sequence of one or more edges between vertices.
disconnected: Graph where at least two vertices have no path connecting them.
weighted: Graph where edges have an associated cost.
directed: Graph where travel between vertices can be restricted to a single direction.
cycle: A path which begins and ends at the same vertex.
adjacency matrix: Graph representation where vertices are both the rows and the columns. Each cell represents a possible edge.
adjacency list: Graph representation where each vertex has a list of all the vertices it shares an edge with.


What do they know and what can they do-
Vertex stores some data.
Vertex stores the edges to connected vertices and their weight.
Vertex can add a new edge to its collection.
Graph stores all the vertices.
Graph knows if it is directed or undirected.
Graph can add a new vertex to its collection.
Graph can add a new edge between stored vertices.
Graph can tell whether a path exists between stored vertices.
