create dictionary to map vertices to their distance from start vertex

assign start vertex a distance of 0 in min heap

assign every other vertex a distance of infinity in min heap

remove the vertex with the minimum distance from the min heap and set it to the current vertex

while min heap is not empty:
  for each current vertex:
    for each neighbor in neighbors:
    new distance = (distance to current vertex) + (edge weight of current vertex to neighbor)

    if new distance is less than its current distance:
      current distance = new distance

return distances
