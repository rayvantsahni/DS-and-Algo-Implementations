# Sorting Algorithms
- ### Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is an algorithm to sort a list through repeated swaps of adjacent elements. It has a runtime of `O(N^2)`.

- ### Merge Sort:
Merge Sort has the best, worst, and average time complexity all the same as `Î˜(N*log(N))`. Merge sort also requires space. Each separation requires a temporary array, and so a merge sort would require enough space to save the whole of the input a second time. This means the worst-case space complexity of merge sort is `O(N)`.
