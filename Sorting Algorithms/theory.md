# Sorting Algorithms
- ### Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is an algorithm to sort a list through repeated swaps of adjacent elements. It has a runtime of `O(N^2)`.

- ### Merge Sort:
Merge Sort has the best, worst, and average time complexity all the same as `Î˜(N*log(N))`. Merge sort also requires space. Each separation requires a temporary array, and so a merge sort would require enough space to save the whole of the input a second time. This means the worst-case space complexity of merge sort is `O(N)`.

- ### Quick Sort:
Quicksort is an efficient recursive algorithm for sorting arrays or lists of values. The algorithm is a _comparison_ sort, where values are ordered by a comparison operation such as **>** or **<**. Quicksort is an unusual algorithm in that the worst case runtime is `O(N^2)`, but the average case is `O(N*log(N))`.
